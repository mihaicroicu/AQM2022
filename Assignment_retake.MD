Assignment 1 supplementation:

1. Import UCDP GED. You can find a zipped copy here : https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ged/ged211-csv.zip and the codebook here: https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ged/ged211.pdf

2. Filter the data to contain only data from 2015 and onwards (including 2015).

3. Compute a country-year dataset. The dataset should contain the following columns:

```country_id, year, count_of_events, best_fat```

where best_fat is the sum of fatalities in the best estimate of fatalities.

4. List the five most intense (highest number of fatalities in the best category) country years in the dataset.

5. Compute the top 5 countries in which years have had the highest decline in fatalities compared to the previous year. The format of the data should be:

```country_id, year_from, year_to, decline_in_fatalities```

Explain how you did this.
